## Overview

This project brings to life the iconic **Google Chrome Dinosaur** game â€” implemented in Java using Swing and AWT.
You take control of a dinosaur running across the screen, jumping over various cactus (and more) obstacles to keep going.
Through this project, I showcased my ability to create smooth animations, handle real-time keyboard input, and build a functional game loop.

## Key Features

- Animated dinosaur using GIF and static images.
- Jump control via the Space key.
- Random spawning of different obstacles.
- Collision detection that ends the game upon hitting an obstacle.
- Real-time score display.
- Game restart functionality after game over by pressing Space.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: **Java**
- GUI Framework: **Swing / AWT**
- Development Environment: IntelliJ IDEA
- Graphics Format: PNG, GIF (for animation)

## Project Structure

- `App.java` â€” entry point, sets up the window and adds the game panel.
- `ChromeDinosaur.java` â€” main game logic, rendering, and event handling.
- `img/` folder â€” contains image and animation assets (dinosaur, cactuses, etc.).

## What I Learned

- Creating animated sprites using `ImageIcon` and GIFs.
- Implementing a game loop and timers with `javax.swing.Timer`.
- Handling keyboard events for player input.
- Basic jump physics with gravity simulation.
- Collision detection using bounding boxes.
- Managing dynamic collections of game objects.
- Working with 2D graphics in Java.

## Future Improvements

- Add flying bird obstacles.
- Implement crouching mechanic.
- Introduce difficulty levels and increasing speed.
- Add sound effects.
- Optimize rendering and game logic for performance.



**Just clone the repository to run the game ;)**
